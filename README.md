## Instructions

To open the game, you simply need to open the HTML file.

The goal of the game is to help the little boy to get to the river, without touching the bugs.

To move the boy, you have to press on the `left`, `right`, `up` and `down` keys on your keyboard.

If you touch the bugs, you will have to restart the game.
